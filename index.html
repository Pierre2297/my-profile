<h2> My background 📝 </h2>

<h3> - Paris 🇫🇷 - </h3>
	<img width="300", height="180px" src="images/paris.jpg">
		<p> My hometown is Paris. I spent most of my childhood here. It's a city with an incredible cultural richness (food, architecture, monuments, museums...). One of my favourite districts is Saint-Germain des Prés with its calm and soothing streets between the Seine and the church.

<h3> - London 🇬🇧 - </h3>

		<p> This is currently the city where I have been living for 4 years for my studies. I left just after graduating from high school to study. I really like this multicultural city which is constantly active.
